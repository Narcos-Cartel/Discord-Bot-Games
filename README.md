Discord Bot Games
This is a Discord bot that includes three games: Mines, Rock-Paper-Scissors, and TicTacToe.

Games
Mines
Mines is a classic puzzle game where the goal is to uncover all the cells on the board that do not contain mines. The game is won when all non-mine cells are uncovered, and it is lost when a mine cell is uncovered.

Rock-Paper-Scissors
Rock-Paper-Scissors is a popular hand game played by two people. The game is simple - each player simultaneously forms one of three shapes with their hand: a rock (fist), paper (open hand), or scissors (fist with index and middle fingers extended). The winner is determined by the rules: rock beats scissors, scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock.

TicTacToe
TicTacToe is a classic game played on a 3x3 grid. The game is won by placing three X's or O's in a row, column, or diagonal.
